Machine Learning Introduction:
Machine Learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to learn patterns from data 
without being explicitly programmed. ML models improve their performance over time as they get more data.
It involves techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning etc.
Machine learning is widely used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, natural language processing, 
computer vision, healthcare analytics, finance modelling and more.
Popular ML algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks etc.
